## 🧪 Open Research

Research-first repositories where I iterate on methods, ablations, and publication-focused experiments:

| Project | Focus | Repository | Last Updated |
|---|---|---|---|
| ParamHam | Parametrized Hamiltonians + implicit differentiation for bilevel Max-Cut | [paramham-lab](https://github.com/eybmits/paramham-lab) | 2026-02-26 |
| QRC Budget | Budget-aware QRC studies, ablations, and crossover analysis | [qrc_budget](https://github.com/eybmits/qrc_budget) | 2026-02-27 |

## GitHub Activity

I use GitHub's native contribution graph (shown at the top of this profile) so activity stays fully up to date.

## What I'm Working On

- Turning QRC research into reproducible, well-documented repositories.
- Building tooling that connects theory, experiments, and visualization.
- Keeping public docs concise and easy to onboard.

### Working Style

**Ship > perfect.**

I publish early, document transparently, and iterate fast.
